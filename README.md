# Velican

Velican is professional blogging software based on pelican python library for static site generation.

## Lightweight

The site is pre-generated by [pelican](https://getpelican.com) to have feeds and post previews ready.
Unlike pure pelican, the site is generated in semantic HTML that is later read by Vue application and
displayed to user. This makes it extremely fast on client side and lightweight on server side.

## Fully web based

The downside of statically generated sites is that you need to write the posts somewhere and then transfer
them to your server. Velican solves this pain-point by using WebDAV protocol for writing files to the server.
WebDAV is amazing standardized protocol that is implemented by all mainline webservers. It works pretty much
like Dropbox or Google Drive. Part of Velican installation is web based markdown editor with webdav navigator
so you can edit your posts comfortably online - still without any backend.

## Unhackable

Security is the main advantage of statically generated sites. If you use HTTPS then your only security 
concert is securing your WebDAV endpoint. Because of encrypted traffic, you can use basic authorization
provided by your favorite webserver. Accounts can be stored in httpasswd file or some webservers even
support integration with LDAP.
